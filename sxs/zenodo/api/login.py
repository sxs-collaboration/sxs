class Login(object):

    def __init__(self, sandbox=False, access_token=None, access_token_path=None,

        """Initialize a Login object for interacting with zenodo

        This object encapsulates the credentials needed to interact with the Zenodo API, and exposes
        a Session object that can be used to make requests which automatically include the
        credentials.  It can be used for generic requests, but note that other objects in this
        module make certain tasks easier -- such as creating or modifying a "deposit", which is
        Zenodo's name for a new upload.  The Deposit object should be created from this object.

        These actions require a Zenodo API access token.  These are obtained from the website --
        either
            https://zenodo.org/account/settings/applications/tokens/new/
        or
            https://sandbox.zenodo.org/account/settings/applications/tokens/new/
        Note that zenodo.org and sandbox.zenodo.org use separate login systems and separate access
        tokens.  The access token may either be passed as a string to this function (though that
        means it will probably be found in some script file somewhere, which is probably not a good
        idea for security), or can be read from a file.  By default the file from which the token is
        read is '~/.credentials/zenodo/zenodo_access_token' or the same name with '_sandbox' appended.
        Thus, it is probably easiest to simply place your access tokens in those files, so that no
        arguments need to be passed to this function.  As a basic security measure, please ensure
        that those files are not readable by anyone but the user.

        Parameters
        ----------
        sandbox: bool [default: False]
            If True, use the zenodo sandbox site, which is intended solely for testing purposes.
            This site is cleaned out regularly, so you cannot expect any entry to be here for very
            long.

        access_token: string or None [default: None]
            If present, this is used as the Zenodo API access token.

        access_token_path: string or None [default: None]
            If `zenodo_access_token` is not given, this file is read and the first line is used as the
            access token.  If this argument is None, it defaults to either
            '~/.credentials/zenodo/zenodo_access_token' for the regular website or
            '~/.credentials/zenodo/access_token_sandbox' for the sandbox website.

        total_retry_count: int [default: 50]
            Total number of times to retry requests that fail for retry-able reasons.

        backoff_factor: float [default: 0.1]
            A delay factor to apply between requests after the second try (most errors are resolved
            immediately by a second try without a delay).  After a certain number of total retries,
            the request Session will sleep for:

                {backoff factor} * (2 ^ ({number of total retries} - 1))

            seconds before trying again. For example, if the `backoff_factor` is 0.1, then the
            session will sleep for [0.0s, 0.2s, 0.4s, ...] between retries.  It will never be longer
            than `backoff_max`.

        backoff_max: float [default: 20.0]
            Longest time (in seconds) to wait between retries.

        session: requests.Session or None [default: None]
            This is the object that handles all of the requests made to the API.  If `None`, a
            Session is created for you, and sensible default headers (including the access token)
            are created.  If you need to adjust some of the Session parameters like proxies or SSL
            verification, you can simply create your own and pass it in here.  Note that any `auth`
            property on the passed object will be replaced by one that adds this to the header of
            each request to the chosen Zenodo domain:
                {"Authorization": "Bearer <YourAccessTokenHere>"}

        Optional parameters
        -------------------

            Filter result based on deposit status.
        sort: string [optional]
            Sort order ('bestmatch' or 'mostrecent').  Prefix with minus to change from ascending to
            descending (e.g., '-mostrecent').
        page: int [optional, defaults to 1]
            Page number for pagination
        size: int [optional, defaults to 1000]
            Number of results to return per page.  Note that Zenodo (as of this writing) seems to
            place a hard limit of 9999 responses.  Anything more will result in an error.  Use
            multiple pages to get more results.
