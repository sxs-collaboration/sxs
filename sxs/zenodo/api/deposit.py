            Specify the conditions under which you grant users access to the files in your

            conditions. Based on the justification, you decide who to grant/deny access. You are not
            allowed to charge users for granting access to data hosted on Zenodo. Following HTML

            List of communities in which you wish the deposit to appear. The owner of the
            community will be notified, and can either accept or reject your request. Each array
            element is a dictionary with the key 'identifier' followed by the name of a Zenodo
            community.

        doi: string
            Digital Object Identifier. Did a publisher already assign a DOI to your deposited files?
            If not, leave the field empty and we will register a new DOI for you when you publish. A

        prereserve_doi: bool
            Set to `True`, to reserve a Digital Object Identifier (DOI). The DOI is automatically
            generated by our system and cannot be changed. Also, The DOI is not registered with
            DataCite until you publish your deposit, and thus cannot be used before
            then. Reserving a DOI is useful, if you need to include it in the files you upload, or
            if you need to provide a dataset DOI to your publisher but not yet publish your
            dataset. The response from the REST API will include the reserved DOI.

        related_identifiers: list of dictionaries
