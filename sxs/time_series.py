    This object wraps the basic numpy array object, but stores (at least a

    Parameters
    ----------
    input_array : (..., N, ...) array_like
        Input data representing the dependent variable, in any form that can be
        converted to a numpy array.  This includes scalars, lists, lists of tuples,
        tuples, tuples of tuples, tuples of lists, and numpy ndarrays.  It can have
        an arbitrary number of dimensions, but the length `N` along `time_axis`
        (see below) must match the length of `time`.  Values must be finite.
    time : (N,) array_like
        1-D array containing values of the independent variable.  Values must be
        real, finite, and in strictly increasing order.
    time_axis : int, optional
        Axis along which `input_array` is assumed to be varying in time, meaning
        that for `time[i]` the corresponding values are `np.take(input_array, i,
        axis=time_axis)`.  If this is not given, the first axis of `input_array`
        that has the same length as `time` is chosen as the time axis â€” which may
        be prone to errors.

        First, if a single element is requested along the time dimension, that
        dimension will not be removed.  For a 2-d ndarray `arr`, taking `arr[3]` will
        return a 1-d array; the first dimension will be removed because only the third
        element is extracted.  For a 2-d TimeSeries `ts` with `time_axis=0`, `ts[3]`
        will return a 2-d TimeSeries; the first dimension will just have size 1,
        representing the third element.  If the requested element is not along the time
        dimension, the requested dimension will be removed as usual.

        Also, taking an irregular slice of this object is not permitted.  For example:

            >>> a = np.arange(3*4).reshape(3, 4)
            >>> a[a % 5 == 0]
            array([ 0,  5, 10])

        Even though `a % 5 == 0` is a 2-d array, indexing flattens `a` and the indexing
        set, so that the result is a 1-d array.  This probably does not make sense for
        TimeSeries arrays, so attempting to do something like this raises a ValueError.

        The effect is achieved by multiplying the array's data by the

        `abs_tolerance` to between 1 and 2.  Thus, all digits less
        significant than 1 are less significant than `abs_tolerance` â€”
        meaning that we can apply the standard `round` routine to set
        these digits to 0.  We then divide by that same power of 2 to
        bring the array data back to nearly its original value.  By
        working with powers of 2, we ensure that the 0s at the
        intermediate stage are represented as 0 bits in the final

        """Subtract a linear function of time from the data

        This is very similar to the `detrend` function found in the
        signal-processing literature and in SciPy and MATLAB, for
        example, except that rather than fitting a line to all of the
        data (which is more appropriate for noisy data), this function
        subtracts the line connecting the two ends (first and last
        time steps) of the data.  This ensures that there is no
        discontinuity in the data at the boundaries, which is not
        guaranteed by the usual `detrend` functions.

        Parameters
        ----------
        treat_as_zero : str, optional
            Whether to treat the data at the boundaries as zero.
            Default value is `"begin"`, meaning that we pretend that
            the data at the beginning of the time array is oscillating
            around zero, so we can treat it as if it *is* zero.  If
            the early data has already been tapered, it will probably
            already be zero, so this shouldn't matter.  In that case,
            `"neither"` would also be correct.  The option `"end"` is
            also accepted, but this will be less likely to be needed.

        Returns
        -------
        TimeSeries
            New object with the linear function of time subtracted.

        Notes
        -----
        There is a minor subtlety in the implementation of this
        function.  It is not quite enough to simply subtract the line
        connecting the first and last data points.  The discrete
        Fourier transform implicitly assumes that the data is
        periodic, so that the line should connect the first data point
        to *one beyond the last data point*.  It is not generally
        clear how to define that, but assuming that the data has
        roughly settled down to be roughly constant by the end, we can
        say that the line should connect `(time[0], data[0])` to
        `(time[-1]+dt, data[-1])`, where `dt` is the time-step size.
        This is the approach taken here.  Even this is only
        approximate, but typically this should be such a tiny effect
        as to not matter at all, though it could improve results for
        very short or highly changing time series.
