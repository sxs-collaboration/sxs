"""Convert to/from LVC-NR format

The LVC-NR format was first described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01076.  The de
facto format definition is in the code that checks it, which seems to be the
`lvcnrpy` module â€” more specifically, the classes in lvcnrpy.format.specs at
https://git.ligo.org/waveforms/lvcnrpy

Note that most of the code in this submodule is adapted from code written by Alyssa
Garcia, Geoffrey Lovelace, and Patricia Schmidt.
