    Parameters
    ----------
    path : str
        SXS-style path to a file â€” for example, r"SXS:BBH:0123\Lev4:Horizons.h5"
        becomes r"SXS_BBH_0123\Lev4_Horizons.h5" on Windows.  Other systems can
        handle the original path, so are not changed.

    Notes
    -----
    SXS-style paths begin with SXS IDs, which contain colon characters.  These
    colons are incompatible with Windows file systems, so we simply replace the
    colons with underscores.

def cached_path(path_pattern):

    Parameters
    ----------
    path_pattern : str
        A pattern to search for among the catalog files.  See the docstring of
        `sxs.Catalog.select` for details about how this pattern is used.

    Returns
    -------
    path : pathlib.Path
        Full path to file on this system.  The file may not exist.

    Raises
    ------
    StopIteration
        When no result is found for the input `path_pattern`.

    Notes
    -----
    This function returns just one path, corresponding to the first result returned
    by `catalog.select_files(path_pattern)`.
