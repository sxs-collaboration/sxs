def Simulation(location, *args, **kwargs):
    """Construct a Simulation object from a location string

    The location string should be an SXS ID with an optional version
    number, and possibly a Lev specification, as in
    "SXS:BBH:1234v2.0/Lev5".  The default version number is "v2.0",
    and the default Lev number is the highest available.  Note that
    the version number must be in the form "v2.0", not "2.0", and it
    must exist, or no files will be found to load the data from.

    The returned object will be either a `Simulation_v1` or
    `Simulation_v2` object, depending on the version number.
    Hopefully, most details of the two versions will be hidden from
    the user, so that the interface is identical.

    Note that some simulations are deprecated and/or superseded by
    other simulations.  By default, this function will raise an error
    if you try to load a deprecated or superseded simulation.  There
    are several ways to override this behavior:

    1. Pass `ignore_deprecation=True` to completely bypass even
        checking for deprecation or supersession.  No warnings or
        errors will be issued.
    2. Include an explicit version number in the `location`
        string, as in "SXS:BBH:0001v2.0".  A warning will be issued
        that the simulation is deprecated, but it will be loaded
        anyway.
    3. Pass `auto_supersede=True` to automatically load the
        superseding simulation, if there is only one.  Because no
        superseding simulation can be *precisely* the same as the
        deprecated one, there may be multiple superseding simulations
        that have very similar parameters, in which case an error will
        be raised and you must explicitly choose one.  If there is
        only one, a warning will be issued, but the superseding
        simulation will be loaded.

    Otherwise, a `ValueError` will be raised, with an explanation and
    suggestions on what you might want to do.

    Parameters
    ----------
    location : str
        The location string for the simulation.  This must include the
        SXS ID, but can also include the version and Lev number, as
        described above.

    Other parameters
    ----------------
    ignore_deprecation : bool
        If `True`, completely bypass checking for deprecation or
        supersession.  No warnings or errors will be issued.
    auto_supersede : bool
        If `True`, automatically load the superseding simulation, if
        there is only one.  If there are multiple superseding
        simulations, an error will be raised, and you must explicitly
        choose one.  If there is only one, a warning will still be
        issued, but the superseding simulation will be loaded.  Note
        that this can also be set in the configuration file with
        `sxs.write_config(auto_supersede=True)`.
    extrapolation : str
        The extrapolation order to use for the strain and Psi4 data.
        This is only relevant for versions 1 and 2 of the data format,
        both of which default to "N2".  Other options include "N3",
        "N4", and "Outer".  "Nx" refers to extrapolation by
        polynomials in 1/r with degree `x`, while "Outer" refers to
        data extracted at the outermost extraction radius but
        corrected for time-dilation and areal-radius effects.
    download : bool
        If `True`, download the information about the files from the
        Zenodo/CaltechDATA record.  If `False`, only use the file
        information that is already available (which will raise an
        error if the file information has not previously been
        downloaded).  If not present, use the value from the
        configuration file, defaulting to `True` if it is not
        configured.

    Returns
    -------
    simulation : SimulationBase
        A `Simulation_v1` or `Simulation_v2` object, depending on the
        version of the simulation data.

    Note that all remaining arguments (including keyword arguments)
    are passed on to the `SimulationBase`, `Simulation_v1`, and/or
    `Simulation_v2` constructors, though none currently recognize any
    arguments other than those listed above.

    Attributes
    ----------
    metadata : Metadata
        Metadata object for the simulation
    series : pandas.Series
        The metadata, as extracted from the `simulations.dataframe`,
        meaning that it has columns consistent with other simulations,
        even when the underlying Metadata objects do not.  Note that
        `metadata` is an alias for this attribute, just based on the
        use of that name for `simulations`, but technically `pandas`
        distinguishes a single row like this as a `Series` object.
    version : str
        Version number of the simulation
    sxs_id_stem : str
        SXS ID without the version number or Lev
    sxs_id : str
        SXS ID with the version number
    location : str
        Location string for the simulation, including the SXS ID,
        version number, and Lev number.
    url : str
        URL for the DOI of the simulation
    files : dict
        Dictionary of file information for the simulation.  The keys
        are of the form "Lev5:Horizons.h5", and the values are
        dictionaries with keys "checksum", "size", and "link".
    lev_numbers : list
        List of available Lev numbers for the simulation.
    lev_number : int
        Chosen Lev number for the simulation.
    horizons : Horizons
        Horizons object for the simulation
    strain : Waveform
        Strain Waveform object for the simulation.  Note that `h` is
        an alias for this attribute, both of which are case
        insensitive: `Strain` and `H` are also acceptable.
    psi4 : Waveform
        Psi4 Waveform object for the simulation.  Note that this
        attribute is also case insensitive: `Psi4` is also acceptable.
    psi3 : Waveform
        Psi3 Waveform object for the simulation.  Note that this
        attribute is also case insensitive: `Psi3` is also acceptable.
        In versions 1 and 2, this attribute will raise an error
        because the data is not available.
    psi2 : Waveform
        Psi2 Waveform object for the simulation.  Note that this
        attribute is also case insensitive: `Psi2` is also acceptable.
        In versions 1 and 2, this attribute will raise an error
        because the data is not available.
    psi1 : Waveform
        Psi1 Waveform object for the simulation.  Note that this
        attribute is also case insensitive: `Psi1` is also acceptable.
        In versions 1 and 2, this attribute will raise an error
        because the data is not available.
    psi0 : Waveform
        Psi0 Waveform object for the simulation.  Note that this
        attribute is also case insensitive: `Psi0` is also acceptable.
        In versions 1 and 2, this attribute will raise an error
        because the data is not available.
